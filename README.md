# target-markdown-bookdown

Example using target markdown files in a bookdown project

A minimal example example of a book based on R Markdown and **bookdown** was started by using RStudio new project template. Then I added some target markdown using the RStudio template.

I had to edit the target markdown files by moving some stuff into index.Rmd and getting rid of the `tar_visnetwork()` calls which where causing the pdf not to build.
