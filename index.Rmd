# About

This is a _sample_ book written in **Markdown**. Test using {targets}.

Near the top of the document, you may also wish to remove the `_targets_r` directory previously written by non-interactive runs of the report. Otherwise, your pipeline may contain superfluous targets.


```{r}
targets::tar_unscript()
```

## Setup

If you are using old versions of `targets` (<= 0.7.0) and/or `knitr` (<= 1.33), you will need to load the `targets` package in the R Markdown document in order for Target Markdown code chunks to work.

```{r}
library(targets)
```

## Globals

We first define some global options/functions common to all targets. The function below plots a histogram of ozone concentrations, and our histogram target will need it.

```{targets example-globals2, tar_globals = TRUE}
options(tidyverse.quiet = TRUE)
tar_option_set(packages = c("biglm", "dplyr", "ggplot2", "readr", "tidyr"))
create_plot <- function(data) {
  ggplot(data) +
    geom_histogram(aes(x = Ozone), bins = 12) +
    theme_gray(24)
}
```


```{r}
tar_make()
```


```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```
