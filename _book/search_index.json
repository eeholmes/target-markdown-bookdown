Test using {targets}. Near the top of the document, you may also wish to remove the _targets_r directory previously written by non-interactive runs of the report. Otherwise, your pipeline may contain superfluous targets. targets::tar_unscript() 1.1 Setup If you are using old versions of targets (&lt;= 0.7.0) and/or knitr (&lt;= 1.33), you will need to load the targets package in the R Markdown document in order for Target Markdown code chunks to work. library(targets) ## Warning: package &#39;targets&#39; was built under R version 4.1.2 1.2 Globals We first define some global options/functions common to all targets. The function below plots a histogram of ozone concentrations, and our histogram target will need it. options(tidyverse.quiet = TRUE) tar_option_set(packages = c(&quot;biglm&quot;, &quot;dplyr&quot;, &quot;ggplot2&quot;, &quot;readr&quot;, &quot;tidyr&quot;)) create_plot &lt;- function(data) { ggplot(data) + geom_histogram(aes(x = Ozone), bins = 12) + theme_gray(24) } ## Establish _targets.R and _targets_r/globals/example-globals2.R. tar_make() ## • end pipeline ## Warning message: ## package ‘targets’ was built under R version 4.1.2 "],["chapter-1.html", "Chapter 2 Chapter 1 2.1 Packages 2.2 Targets 2.3 Pipeline 2.4 Output", " Chapter 2 Chapter 1 Target Markdown is a powerful R Markdown interface for reproducible analysis pipelines, and the chapter at https://books.ropensci.org/targets/markdown.html walks through it in detail.

Try it out in both interactive and non-interactive modes, either by running the code chunks in different ways or setting the tar_interactive chunk option. 2.1 Packages The example requires several R packages, and targets must be version 0.5.0.9000 or above. install.packages(c(&quot;biglm&quot;, &quot;dplyr&quot;, &quot;ggplot2&quot;, &quot;readr&quot;, &quot;targets&quot;, &quot;tidyr&quot;)) 2.2 Targets Our first target borrows the airquality dataset built into base R. tar_target(raw_data, airquality) #&gt; Establish _targets.R and _targets_r/targets/raw-data.R.

Set the tar_simple chunk option to TRUE to define a single target with the command in the code chunk.
